Don\'t focus on them and focus on small things. Remember, it\'s not who you are today that determines your destiny, but who you will be tomorrow. Gone are the days when we waited for the "apple to ripen". Those who are fast, ambitious and fearless are getting results. That\'s what I\'ve always said as my motto. The choice is yours: either you wake up now and try, or you continue to dream in your dreams.',

Each trader installs on his computer a terminal that connects with the broker\'s service, through which he trades and gives orders to buy and sell currency using this program. How to start trading After opening a real trading account, the question arises: "How to make money in Forex without knowing about all the intricacies of speculative exchange rate differences?" .
